# FlaskPythonAPI
We have a list of products, and we want to create an API to manage them.
We have 5 endpoints:
- GET /ping: to test the API.
- GET /products: to get all the products.
- GET /products/<string:product_name>: to get a single product.
- POST /products: to add a product.
- PUT /products/<string:product_name>: to edit a product.
- DELETE /products/<string:product_name>: to delete a product.
